## 📝 Project Use Case

This project was created as part of an internship and personal portfolio. It simulates an AI interviewer that can answer questions like:

- "Explain the data science workflow briefly."
- "How do you deal with imbalanced datasets?"
- "Use STAR method to describe a challenge during internship."

Answers were generated and improved using AI and saved as screenshots for reference.

## ✅ Future Scope

- Add vector search grounding to allow document-based context
- Host via Flask + React frontend
- Create categorized Q&A sets for different domains
